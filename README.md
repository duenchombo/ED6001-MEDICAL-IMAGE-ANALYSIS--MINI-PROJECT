## Project Overview

`Lung cancer` remains the leading cause of **cancer-related mortality worldwide**. Unfortunately, only 16% of cases are diagnosed at an **early**, localized stage, where patients have a **five-year survival rate exceeding 50%**. When lung cancer is identified at more **advanced stages**, the survival rate plummets to just **5%**.

Given this stark difference, `early diagnosis is critical` for improving patient outcomes. Non-invasive imaging methods, such as **computed tomography (CT)**, have proven effective in providing crucial information regarding tumor status. This opens opportunities for developing **computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems** capable of assessing the malignancy risk of lung nodules and **supporting clinical decision-making**.

The goal of this project is to create a **machine learning-based solution for classifying lung nodules as benign or malignant using CT images** available within **LIDC-IDRI dataset**.

## Project Development

### Dependencies & Execution

### Planned Work

The project will involve several `key phases`, including:

- `Data Preprocessing` : **Cleaning and preparing the CT scan data** to ensure its quality and consistency for further analysis.
- `Feature Engineering` : Leveraging **radiomics** to extract meaningful **features** from the scans.
- `Model Development and Evaluation` : **Training and fine-tuning support vector machine learning model** to accurately classify lung nodules based on their malignancy status. It also focuses on assessing **model performance** using key metrics such as **balanced accuracy** and **AUC**, and validating results through robust methods such as **k-fold cross-validation**.
